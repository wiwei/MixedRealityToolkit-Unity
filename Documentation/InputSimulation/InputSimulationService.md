# Input Simulation Service

The Input Simulation Service emulates the behaviour of devices and platforms that may not be available in the Unity editor. Examples include:
* HoloLens or VR device head tracking
* HoloLens hand gestures
* HoloLens 2 articulated hand tracking

Users can use a conventional keyboard and mouse combination to control simulated devices at runtime. This allows testing of interactions in the Unity editor without first deploying to a device.

> [!WARNING]
> This does not work when using Unity's XR Holographic Emulation > Emulation Mode = "Simulate in Editor". Unity's in-editor simulation will take control away from MRTK's input simulation. In order to use the MRTK input simulation service, you will need to set XR Holographic Emulation to Emulation Mode = *"None"*

## Enabling the Input Simulation Service

Input simulation is enabled by default in MRTK.

Input simulation is an optional [Mixed Reality service](../MixedRealityServices.md). It can be added as a data provider in the [Input System profile](../Input/InputProviders.md).
* __Type__ must be _Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Input > InputSimulationService_.
* __Platform(s)__ should always be _Windows Editor_ since the service depends on keyboard and mouse input.
* __Profile__ has all settings for input simulation.

> [!WARNING]
> Any type of profile can be assigned to services at the time of this writing. If you assign a different profile to the service, make sure to use a profile of type _Input Simulation_ or it will not work!

# Camera Control

Head movement can be emulated by the Input Simulation Service.

</a>

## Rotating the camera

1. Hover over the viewport editor window.

   _You may need to click the window to give it input focus if button presses don't work._

2. Press and hold the __Mouse Look Button__ (default: Right mouse button).
3. Move the mouse in the viewport window to rotate the camera.

## Moving the camera

Press and hold the movement keys (W/A/S/D for forward/left/back/right).

# Hand Simulation

The input simulation supports emulated hand devices. These virtual hands can interact with any object that supports regular hand devices, such as buttons or grabbable objects.

<a target="_blank" href="../../Documentation/Images/InputSimulation/MRTK_InputSimulation_HandSimulationMode.png">
  <img src="../../Documentation/Images/InputSimulation/MRTK_InputSimulation_HandSimulationMode.png" title="Full Hand Mesh" width="80%" class="center" />
</a>

The __Hand Simulation Mode__ switches between two distinct input models.

* _Articulated Hands_: Simulates a fully articulated hand device with joint position data.

   Emulates HoloLens 2 interaction model.

   Interactions that are based on precise positioning of the hand or use touching can be simulated in this mode.

* _Gestures_: Simulates a simplified hand model with air tap and basic gestures.

   Emulates [HoloLens interaction model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/gestures).

   Focus is controlled using the Gaze pointer. The _Air Tap_ gesture is used to interact with buttons.

## Controlling hand movement

  <img src="../../Documentation/Images/InputSimulation/MRTK_InputSimulation_HandControlSettings.png" title="Full Hand Mesh" width="80%" class="center" />
</a>

Press and hold the _Left/Right Hand Manipulation Key_ (default: Left Shift/Space for left/right respectively) to gain control of either hand. While the manipulation key is pressed, the hand will appear in the viewport. Mouse movement will move the hand in the view plane.

Once the manipulation key is released the hands will disappear after a short _Hand Hide Timeout_. To toggle hands on permanently, press the _Toggle Left/Right Hand Key_ (default: T/Y for left/right respectively). Press the toggle key again to hide the hands again.

</a>

Hands can be moved further or closer to the camera using the _mouse wheel_.
By default the hand will move somewhat slowly in response to mouse scroll,
and this can be made faster by changing the *Hand Depth Multiplier* to a
larger number.

The initial distance from the camera that the hand appears at is controlled by
*Default Hand Distance.*

By default, the simulated hand joints will be perfectly still. Note that on devices there
will always be some amount of jitter/noise due to the underlying hand tracking.
You can see this on the device when you have hand mesh or joints enabled (and
see how it has slightly jitter even if you have your hand perfectly still). It's possible
to simulate jitter by changing *Hand Jitter Amount* to a positive value (for example, 0.1
as is shown in the image above).

</a>

Hands can be rotated when precise direction is required.
* Yaw rotates around the Y axis (default: E/Q keys for clockwise/counter-clockwise rotation)
* Pitch rotates around the X axis (default: F/R keys for clockwise/counter-clockwise rotation)
* Roll rotates around the Z axis (default: X/Z keys for clockwise/counter-clockwise rotation)

## Hand Gestures

Hand gestures such as pinching, grabbing, poking, etc. can also be simulated.

  <img src="../../Documentation/Images/InputSimulation/MRTK_InputSimulation_HandGestureSettings.png" title="Full Hand Mesh" width="80%" class="center" />
</a>

1. First enable hand control using the manipulation keys (Left Shift/Space)

   Alternatively toggle the hands on/off using the toggle keys (T/Y).

2. While manipulating, press and hold a mouse button to perform a hand gesture.

Each of the mouse buttons can be mapped to transform the hand shape into a different gesture using the _Left/Middle/Right Mouse Hand Gesture_ settings. The _Default Hand Gesture_ is the shape of the hand when no button is pressed.

> [!NOTE]
> The _Pinch_ gesture is the only gesture that performs the "Select" action at this point.

## One-Hand Manipulation

1. Press and hold hand control key (Space/Left Shift)
2. Point at object
3. Hold mouse button to pinch
4. Use mouse to move the object
5. Release mouse button to stop interaction

## Two-Hand Manipulation

For manipulating objects with two hands at the same time the persistent hand mode is recommended.

1. Toggle on both hands by pressing the toggle keys (T/Y).
2. Manipulate one hand at a time:
  1. Hold _Space_ to control the right hand
  2. Move the hand to where you want to grab the object
  3. Press mouse button to activate the _Pinch_ gesture. In persistent mode the gesture will remain active when you release the mouse button.
3. Repeat the process with the other hand, grabbing the same object in a second spot.
4. Now that both hands are grabbing the same object, you can move either of them to perform two-handed manipulation.

## GGV Interaction

1. Enable GGV simulation by switching __Hand Simulation Mode__ to _Gestures_ in the [Input Simulation Profile](#enabling-the-input-simulation-service)

</a>

2. Rotate the camera to point the gaze cursor at the interactable object (right mouse button)
3. Hold _Space_ to control the right hand
4. Click and hold _left mouse button_ to interact
5. Rotate the camera again to manipulate the object
